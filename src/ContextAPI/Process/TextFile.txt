Problem with this:

1. If there are too much data, you need to nest lots of function, and calling them 
2. Solution: useContext

/*
  return (
    <Data.Consumer>
        {(name) => {
            return (
                <Data1.Consumer>
                    {(age) => {
                        return(
                            <p>My name is {name}, and I'm {age} years old</p>
                        )
                    }}
                </Data1.Consumer>
            )
        }}
    </Data.Consumer>
  )

*/ 

For two data's, that's so long!
